    <p>
        You’ll only need a few ingredients—avocado, eggs, feta, seasoning, a tortilla and lime—to make this TikTok egg breakfast. Start by heating a pan on the stove, then sprinkle feta cheese around the edges and crack an egg in the middle. Cook the egg as you typically would for a fried egg, then serve it over a tortilla with smashed avocado. It’s so quick and easy to make, you’ll definitely want to add it to your breakfast rotation.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons feta cheese, crumbled</li>
        <li>Pinch of ground black pepper and crushed red chili flakes, optional</li>
        <li>Tortillas, avocado and lime juice, for serving</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1: Fry the egg with feta</h3>
    <p>Heat a small nonstick skillet over medium heat. Once hot, sprinkle the feta around the edge of a pan, leaving the center free of cheese. Let the cheese melt for a few seconds, then crack the egg into the center of the skillet. Season with pepper and chili flakes, if desired. Cook for 1-2 minutes until the white turns opaque, then cover the skillet with a lid.        
    </p>
    <p>Continue to cook until the whites are fully set, and some white has set over the yolk, about 1 to 2 minutes.</p>
    <h3>Step 2: Serve as desired</h3>
    <p>Uncover, let any excess water in the skillet cook off for 30 seconds and then serve the feta egg as desired. One popular TikTok method from @graceelkus is serving the finished feta egg over a tortilla with smashed avocado and a squeeze of fresh lime juice.
    </p>
    <p>Editor’s Tip: Allow the excess water in the skillet to evaporate after uncovering the egg. That’s the trick to getting those perfect crispy feta cheese edges!</p>
