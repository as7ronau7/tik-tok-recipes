        This TikTok salmon bowl comes courtesy of creator @emilymariko. To make her popular dish, you’ll need two main ingredients, salmon and rice, and they don’t even have to be made to order. Emily uses leftovers—and I’ll never turn down a good leftovers repurposing—but fresh ingredients will also do the trick.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1-2 cooked salmon fillets, about 4 ounces each</li>
        <li>2 cups cooked white rice</li>
        <li>1 ice cube</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
        <li>drizzle of kewpie</li>
        <li>drizzle of sriracha</li>
        <li>1/2 avocado sliced</li>
        <li>kimchi</li>
        <li>roasted seaweed strips</li>
        <li>sesame seeds, optional</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1: Flake salmon</h3>
    <p>Use a fork to flake the cooked salmon until it’s fluffy and there are no more big chunks.        
    </p>
    <h3>Step 2: Reheat in the microwave</h3>
    <p>Add the rice over the flaked salmon, then place an ice cube in the middle of the rice. Cover with parchment paper so the steam won’t escape during heating. Microwave on high for about 2 minutes. Remove from the microwave and discard the parchment.</p>
    <h3>Step 3: Mix and top</h3>
    <p>Add the soy sauce to the salmon and rice and mix until it’s all fully incorporated. Drizzle zigzags of sriracha and mayo on top. Finish with the slices of avocado, kimchi and a sprinkle of sesame seeds if you’d like.</p>
    <h3>What's with the Ice Cube?</h3>
    <p>Leftover rice tends to build a crunchy outer shell after a day or two, but reheating rice with water actually helps recreate the signature fluff. This is due to the power of steam, a hot and extremely effective way of cooking.
