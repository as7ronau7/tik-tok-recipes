        You’ll only need a few ingredients—avocado, eggs, feta, seasoning, a tortilla and lime—to make this TikTok egg breakfast. Start by heating a pan on the stove, then sprinkle feta cheese around the edges and crack an egg in the middle. Cook the egg as you typically would for a fried egg, then serve it over a tortilla with smashed avocado. It’s so quick and easy to make, you’ll definitely want to add it to your breakfast rotation.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cans (4 ounces each) chopped green chiles</li>
        <li>1/4 cup sliced ripe olives</li>
        <li>1/4 cup finely chopped onion</li>
        <li>2 cups sharp shredded cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>4 large eggs</li>
        <li>1-1/2 cups biscuit/baking mix</li>
        <li>2 cups 2% milk</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon pepper</li>
        <li>1 cup 4% small-curd cottage cheese</li>
        <li>Optional: Salsa and sour cream</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1:</h3>
    <p>Preheat oven to 350°. Spread green chiles in a greased 11x7-in. baking dish; sprinkle with olives, onion and cheese. In a large bowl, whisk eggs, biscuit mix, milk and pepper until blended. Stir in cottage cheese; pour over top.       
    </p>
    <h3>Step 2:</h3>
    <p>Bake, uncovered, until golden brown, puffed and a knife inserted in the center comes out clean, 45-50 minutes. Let stand 5-10 minutes before serving. If desired, serve with salsa and sour cream.
    </p>
    <h3>Step 3:</h3>
    <p><strong>To Make Ahead: </strong>Refrigerate unbaked souffle, covered, several hours or overnight. To use, preheat oven to 350°. Remove souffle from refrigerator while oven heats. Bake, as directed, increasing time as necessary until golden and puffed, and a knife inserted in the center comes out clean. Let stand 5-10 minutes before serving.</p>
